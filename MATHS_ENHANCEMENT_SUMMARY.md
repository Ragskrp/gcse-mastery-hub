## 💡 Example Student Journey

**Student:** "I don't get compound interest"  
**App provides:**
1. **Section 1:** Clear definition, key terms (principal, APR, compounding)
2. **Section 2:** Visual: simple interest (flat line) vs compound (exponential curve)
3. **Section 3:** Worked example: £1000 at 5% over 3 years (step-by-step)
4. **Section 4:** Practice questions (easy to hard) with instant feedback
5. **Section 6:** Interactive calculator to "play" with rates/terms
6. **Real-world:** "This is how mortgages work" + "This is how your savings grow"

**Result:** Student goes from confused → understands concept → can apply to real problems
