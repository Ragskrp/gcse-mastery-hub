Remember to put a '0' placeholder when multiplying by the tens digit.\n- Decimals: Ignore decimal points, multiply as integers, then put the decimal point back. The answer has the same total decimal places as the question steps combined.\n\nDivision:\n- Short Division (Bus Stop): Good for single digit divisors.\n- Long Division: Essential for 2-digit divisors (e.g. dividing by 13).
