        "Factor 1 — The Church: The Church controlled education and promoted Galen's ideas as they matched the belief in God's design. Anyone who challenged Galen could be accused of heresy. This meant new ideas were suppressed.",
        "Factor 2 — Communication: With no printing press until 1440, new ideas spread slowly. Most people were illiterate, so knowledge stayed with a small elite.",
        "Factor 3 — War and Instability: Constant wars meant resources went to fighting, not medical research. Libraries and manuscripts were destroyed.",
        "Link: These factors combined to create an environment where old ideas were preserved rather than challenged."
