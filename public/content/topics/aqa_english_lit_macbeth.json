      "heading": "Lady Macbeth's Introduction (Act 1, Scene 5)",
      "content": "Lady Macbeth first appears reading Macbeth's letter about the witches' prophecy. She immediately begins planning Duncan's murder, calling on spirits to 'unsex me here' — asking to be stripped of feminine qualities. She calls Macbeth 'too full o' th' milk of human kindness', suggesting he is too gentle for murder. This establishes her as ambitious, manipulative, and willing to reject her femininity for power.",
      "key_points": [
        "'Unsex me here' — rejects femininity, links to gender theme",
        "'Fill me from the crown to the toe top-full of direst cruelty' — wants to be unnaturally cruel",

        "Shakespeare uses imperative verbs showing her control"

      "heading": "The Murder and Manipulation (Act 1, Scene 7 & Act 2)",
      "content": "When Macbeth hesitates, Lady Macbeth questions his masculinity: 'When you durst do it, then you were a man.' She is practical — she plans the details, drugs the guards, and is frustrated when Macbeth brings the daggers back. She says 'A little water clears us of this deed' — showing her initial lack of guilt. Her strength here contrasts with her later breakdown.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "Lady Macbeth's Decline (Act 5, Scene 1)",
      "content": "By Act 5, Lady Macbeth is sleepwalking, obsessively washing her hands: 'Out, damned spot!' The doctor says she needs a priest, not a physician — suggesting her illness is spiritual guilt. She speaks in prose (not verse), reflecting her mental disintegration. Her death (reported offstage) symbolises how guilt destroys those who pursue power through evil.",
      "key_points": [
        "'Out, damned spot!' — guilt has consumed her",
        "Handwashing = trying to cleanse guilt (contrast with Act 2)",
        "Prose instead of verse = breakdown of order and control",

      "question": "How does Shakespeare present Lady Macbeth as a powerful woman? (30 marks)",
      "step_by_step": [
        "Introduction: Lady Macbeth is presented as powerful through her ambition, manipulation of Macbeth, and rejection of gender norms — though this power ultimately destroys her.",
        "Paragraph 1 (Act 1.5): 'Unsex me here' — imperative verb 'unsex' shows she commands supernatural forces. The word suggests power requires rejecting femininity, reflecting Jacobean views that women should be passive.",
        "Paragraph 2 (Act 1.7): She manipulates Macbeth by questioning his masculinity — 'When you durst do it, then you were a man.' The conditional 'when...then' makes his manhood dependent on murder. Shakespeare shows her psychological power over him.",
        "Paragraph 3 (Act 5.1): However, her power is ultimately an illusion. 'Out, damned spot!' — the exclamatory cry shows guilt has overwhelmed her. The adjective 'damned' suggests she recognises her own damnation. Shakespeare's message: unnatural power leads to destruction.",
        "Conclusion: Lady Macbeth's arc — from commanding spirits to being commanded by guilt — serves as a warning about the corrupting nature of unchecked ambition."
