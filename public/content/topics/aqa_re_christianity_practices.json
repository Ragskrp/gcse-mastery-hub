      "content": "Baptism: Infant baptism (Catholic, Anglican) welcomes babies into the Church — parents and godparents make promises. Believers' baptism (Baptist) is full immersion for those old enough to choose. Eucharist: Catholics believe bread and wine literally become Christ's body and blood (transubstantiation). Protestants see it as symbolic remembrance.",

      "step_by_step": [
        "Agree: Prayer is direct communication with God. Jesus taught the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13), showing its importance. Many Christians pray daily — it strengthens their relationship with God.",
        "Agree: Prayer brings comfort in difficult times. Philippians 4:6 — 'Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer... present your requests to God.'",
        "Disagree: Some Christians would argue worship is more important as it involves community. Hebrews 10:25 — 'Not giving up meeting together.'",
        "Disagree: Others might say charity work (agape love) is the most important practice — 'Faith without deeds is dead' (James 2:26).",
        "Conclusion: While prayer is fundamental, many Christians would argue it is most effective when combined with worship and action."
