        "term": "Secondary research",
        "definition": "Data that already exists, collected by someone else (e.g., government reports, internet)",

        "term": "Qualitative data",

Without it, businesses are essentially guessing.",

      "heading": "Primary vs Secondary Research",
      "content": "Primary research (field research) involves collecting new data: surveys, questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, observations. It is specific to your needs but expensive and time-consuming. Secondary research (desk research) uses existing data: websites, newspapers, government statistics, market reports. It is cheaper but may be outdated or not specific enough.",
      "key_points": [
        "Primary = new data, specific, expensive, time-consuming",
        "Secondary = existing data, cheaper, quicker, may be outdated",

      "step_by_step": [
        "Point 1 (Advantage): Online surveys can reach a large number of people quickly and cheaply compared to face-to-face interviews.",
        "Development: This is important for a new clothing brand with a limited budget, as they can gather lots of quantitative data on fashion preferences without high costs.",
        "Point 2 (Disadvantage): However, responses may be superficial — customers might not explain WHY they prefer certain styles.",
        "Development: This means the brand may miss important qualitative insights that a focus group would provide.",
        "Judgement: Overall, online surveys are a useful starting point but should be combined with smaller focus groups to gather both quantitative and qualitative data."
