    "overview": "JB Priestley's play is a critique of 1912 capitalism and a call for social responsibility. Inspect Goole interrogates the Birling family about the suicide of Eva Smith to show that 'we are members of one body'.",

      "content": "Written in 1945 (end of WWII, rise of Labour/Welfare State) but set in 1912 (Edwardian era, rigid class system, pre-WWI). Priestley uses dramatic irony (e.g. Birling saying the Titanic is 'unsinkable') to make the 1912 capitalist views look foolish to a 1945 audience.",

        "Para 1: Mr Birling ('community and all that nonsense') — rejects responsibility, symbolises uncaring capitalism.",
        "Para 2: The Inspector ('members of one body') — acts as the moral center, teaching that actions have consequences.",
        "Para 3: The Younger Generation (Sheila/Eric) — they accept guilt ('I'm ashamed of it'), offering hope for the future.",
